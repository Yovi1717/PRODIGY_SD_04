Excited to Share My Latest Project at Prodigy Infotech! ðŸ§©

I've recently created an engaging Java program for solving Sudoku puzzles. This project leverages a backtracking algorithm to solve any given 9x9 Sudoku puzzle, adhering to all the standard rules of the game. Using Java and its core libraries, I developed an efficient and interactive tool that processes and solves Sudoku puzzles with clear, step-by-step feedback.

ðŸ“Š Key Features:

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Efficiently solves the Sudoku puzzle by exploring all possible solutions and backtracking when a conflict is found.
- **Validity Checks**: Ensures that each number placed on the board adheres to Sudoku rulesâ€”each number must be unique in its row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid.
- **Real-time Solution Display**: Outputs the solved Sudoku board in the console for easy verification.
- **Handles Incomplete Puzzles**: Accepts partially filled Sudoku boards and completes them correctly.

ðŸ”§ Technical Skills Showcased:

- **Java Programming**: Demonstrated proficiency in Java, focusing on algorithmic problem-solving.
- **Backtracking Algorithm Implementation**: Utilized recursive backtracking to efficiently solve complex puzzles.
- **Array Manipulation**: Employed multi-dimensional arrays to represent and manipulate the Sudoku board.
- **User-Friendly Console Interface**: Designed a console-based interface for clear input and output interaction.

A huge thank you to Prodigy Infotech for the support!
